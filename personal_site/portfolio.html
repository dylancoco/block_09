                    <p>During my AP Computer Science class in high school, I worked on a project to create a game inspired by "Find Luigi," where players had to locate a specific character hidden among a grid of similar-looking ones. At the time, my programming knowledge was still pretty basic, so the implementation wasn’t the most efficient. I remember using nested loops to generate the grid and randomly placing the target character, but my code wasn’t optimized, and debugging was a frequent challenge. Despite the rough edges, it was exciting to see my project come to life and watch my classmates play and enjoy the game, even if it wasn’t perfect.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, the process taught me a lot about problem-solving and perseverance. I didn’t fully understand concepts like efficient algorithms or best coding practices then, so my approach was often trial and error. For instance, the game lacked smooth functionality, and the UI was basic, but I was proud of what I had accomplished with the knowledge I had. The project also sparked a deeper interest in programming, pushing me to explore new concepts and improve my skills. Even though the game was far from professional, it was a stepping stone that showed me the joy of creating something from scratch and motivated me to keep learning.</p>

                    <p>For the final project of my introductory computer science class during my freshman year of college, I created a grade calculation system that allowed users to input custom percentages for different components of a class, such as exams, assignments, and projects. The idea was to give students a simple way to calculate their grades based on the specific weightings of their class. I designed the system to be interactive, where users could input their scores and corresponding percentages, and it would compute their overall grade. It was a straightforward project, but it required careful thought to ensure the calculations were accurate and user-friendly.</p>
                    <p>This project was a great learning experience, as it challenged me to combine basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions. I had to think critically about how to handle edge cases, like ensuring the percentages added up to 100%, and how to make the system flexible for different grading schemes. While the program was simple, it marked a milestone in my coding journey, showing me how to take a practical problem and solve it with code. Looking back, I’m proud of the project because it laid the foundation for more complex programming endeavors and deepened my interest in creating functional, real-world applications.</p>
